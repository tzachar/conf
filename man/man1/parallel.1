.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
one or more computers. A job is can be a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a
list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that
reads from a pipe. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can then split the input into
blocks and pipe a block into each command in parallel.
.PP
If you use xargs and tee today you will find \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR very easy to
use as \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is written to have the same options as xargs. If
you write loops in shell, you will find \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR may be able to
replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running several
jobs in parallel.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR as input for other programs.
.PP
For each line of input \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will execute \fIcommand\fR with
the line as arguments. If no \fIcommand\fR is given, the line of input is
executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can
often be used as a substitute for \fBxargs\fR or \fBcat | bash\fR.
.SS "Reader's guide"
.IX Subsection "Reader's guide"
Before looking at the options you may want to check out the \fB\s-1EXAMPLE\s0\fRs
after the list of options. That will give you an idea of what \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR is capable of.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fIcommand\fR" 9
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute.  If \fIcommand\fR or the following arguments contain
replacement strings (such as \fB{}\fR) every instance will be substituted
with the input.
.Sp
If \fIcommand\fR is given, \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will behave similar to \fBxargs\fR. If
\&\fIcommand\fR is not given \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will behave similar to \fBcat | sh\fR.
.Sp
The \fIcommand\fR must be an executable, a script or a composed command: an
alias or a function will not work (see why
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=484296).
.IP "\fB{}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{}"
Input line. This replacement string will be replaced by a full line
read from the input source. The input source is normally stdin
(standard input), but can also be given with \fB\-a\fR, \fB:::\fR, or
\&\fB::::\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{}\fR can be changed with \fB\-I\fR.
.Sp
If the command line contains no replacement strings then \fB{}\fR will be
appended to the command line.
.IP "\fB{.}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{.}"
Input line without extension. This replacement string will be replaced
by the input with the extension removed. If the input line contains
\&\fB.\fR after the last \fB/\fR the last \fB.\fR till the end of the string will
be removed and \fB{.}\fR will be replaced with the
remaining. E.g. \fIfoo.jpg\fR becomes \fIfoo\fR, \fIsubdir/foo.jpg\fR becomes
\&\fIsubdir/foo\fR, \fIsub.dir/foo.jpg\fR becomes \fIsub.dir/foo\fR,
\&\fIsub.dir/bar\fR remains \fIsub.dir/bar\fR. If the input line does not
contain \fB.\fR it will remain unchanged.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{.}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-er\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{/}"
Basename of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by
the input with the directory part removed.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{//}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{//}"
Dirname of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by the
dir of the input line. See \fBdirname\fR(1).
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{//}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-dirnamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/.}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{/.}"
Basename of input line without extension. This replacement string will
be replaced by the input with the directory and extension part
removed. It is a combination of \fB{/}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/.}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenameextensionreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{#}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{#}"
Sequence number of the job to run. This replacement string will be
replaced by the sequence number of the job being run. It contains the
same number as \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{#}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-seqreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument. This
positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from input
source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the \fIn\fR'th
argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR).
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n.}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument without
extension. It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n/}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{/}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/.\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n/.}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument
without extension.  It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR, \fB{/}\fR, and
\&\fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) and extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB:::\fR \fIarguments\fR" 9
.IX Item "::: arguments"
Use arguments from the command line as input source instead of stdin
(standard input). Unlike other options for \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR \fB:::\fR is
placed after the \fIcommand\fR and before the arguments.
.Sp
The following are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  (echo file1; echo file2) | parallel gzip
\&  parallel gzip ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel gzip {} ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip {} ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel ::: "gzip file1" "gzip file2"
.Ve
.Sp
To avoid treating \fB:::\fR as special use \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to set the
argument separator to something else. See also \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR.
.Sp
stdin (standard input) will be passed to the first process run.
.Sp
If multiple \fB:::\fR are given, each group will be treated as an input
source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. ::: 1 2 ::: a b c will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.
.Sp
\&\fB:::\fR and \fB::::\fR can be mixed. So these are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 6 7 ::: 4 5 ::: 1 2 3
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 6 7) <(seq 4 5) :::: <(seq 1 3)
\&  parallel \-a <(seq 6 7) echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 4 5) :::: <(seq 1 3)
\&  parallel \-a <(seq 6 7) \-a <(seq 4 5) echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 1 2 3
\&  seq 6 7 | parallel \-a \- \-a <(seq 4 5) echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 1 2 3
\&  seq 4 5 | parallel echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 6 7) \- ::: 1 2 3
.Ve
.IP "\fB::::\fR \fIargfiles\fR" 9
.IX Item ":::: argfiles"
Another way to write \fB\-a\fR \fIargfile1\fR \fB\-a\fR \fIargfile2\fR ...
.Sp
\&\fB:::\fR and \fB::::\fR can be mixed.
.Sp
See \fB\-a\fR, \fB:::\fR and \fB\-\-xapply\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-null\fR" 9
.IX Item "--null"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-0\fR" 9
.IX Item "-0"
.PD
Use \s-1NUL\s0 as delimiter.  Normally input lines will end in \en
(newline). If they end in \e0 (\s-1NUL\s0), then use this option. It is useful
for processing arguments that may contain \en (newline).
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-file\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-file input-file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "-a input-file"
.PD
Use \fIinput-file\fR as input source. If you use this option, stdin
(standard input) is given to the first process run.  Otherwise, stdin
(standard input) is redirected from /dev/null.
.Sp
If multiple \fB\-a\fR are given, each \fIinput-file\fR will be treated as an
input source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. The file \fBfoo\fR contains \fB1 2\fR, the file \fBbar\fR
contains \fBa b c\fR.  \fB\-a foo\fR \fB\-a bar\fR will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.
.Sp
See also \fB\-\-xapply\fR and \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-file\-sep\fR \fIsep-str\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-file-sep sep-str"
Use \fIsep-str\fR instead of \fB::::\fR as separator string between command
and argument files. Useful if \fB::::\fR is used for something else by the
command.
.Sp
See also: \fB::::\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR \fIsep-str\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-sep sep-str"
Use \fIsep-str\fR instead of \fB:::\fR as separator string. Useful if \fB:::\fR
is used for something else by the command.
.Sp
Also useful if you command uses \fB:::\fR but you still want to read
arguments from stdin (standard input): Simply change \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to a
string that is not in the command line.

Input items are terminated by the specified character.  Quotes and
backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken
literally.  Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any
other argument.  This can be used when the input consists of simply
newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to design
your program to use \-\-null where this is possible.  The specified
delimiter may be a single character, a C\-style character escape such
as \en, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.  Octal and
hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.
Multibyte characters are not supported.

Do not start new jobs on a given computer if there is both swap-in and
swap-out activity.

The swap activity is only sampled every 10 seconds as the sampling
takes 1 second to do.

two jobs running on one \s-1CPU\s0 with hyperthreading will run slower than

from that continuously. As \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will stop at end of file we
use \fBtail\fR to continue reading:
.PP
\&\fBecho \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-f jobqueue | parallel\fR
.PP
To submit your jobs to the queue:
.PP
\&\fBecho my_command my_arg \fR>>\fB jobqueue\fR
.PP
You can of course use \fB\-S\fR to distribute the jobs to remote
computers:
.PP
\&\fBecho \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-f jobqueue | parallel \-S ..\fR
.PP
There are a two small issues when using \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR as queue
system/batch manager:
.IP "\(bu" 2
You will get a warning if you do not submit JobSlots jobs within the
first second. E.g. if you have 8 cores and use \fB\-j+2\fR you have to submit
10 jobs. These can be dummy jobs (e.g. \fBecho foo\fR). You can also simply
ignore the warning.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Jobs will be run immediately, but output from jobs will only be
printed when JobSlots more jobs has been started. E.g. if you have 10
jobslots then the output from the first completed job will only be
printed when job 11 is started.
.SH "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as dir processor"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as dir processor"
If you have a dir in which users drop files that needs to be processed
you can do this on GNU/Linux (If you know what \fBinotifywait\fR is
called on other platforms file a bug report):
.PP
\&\fBinotifywait \-q \-m \-r \-e \s-1CLOSE_WRITE\s0 \-\-format \f(CB%w\fB%f my_dir | parallel
\&\-u echo\fR
.PP
This will run the command \fBecho\fR on each file put into \fBmy_dir\fR or
subdirs of \fBmy_dir\fR.
.PP
The \fB\-u\fR is needed because of a small bug in \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. If that
proves to be a problem, file a bug report.
.PP
You can of course use \fB\-S\fR to distribute the jobs to remote
computers:
.PP
\&\fBinotifywait \-q \-m \-r \-e \s-1CLOSE_WRITE\s0 \-\-format \f(CB%w\fB%f my_dir | parallel \-S ..
\&\-u echo\fR
.PP
If the files to be processed are in a tar file then unpacking one file
and processing it immediately may be faster than first unpacking all
files. Set up the dir processor as above and unpack into the dir.
.SH "QUOTING"
.IX Header "QUOTING"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is very liberal in quoting. You only need to quote
characters that have special meaning in shell:
.PP
( ) $ ` ' " < > ; | \e
.PP
and depending on context these needs to be quoted, too:
.PP
* ~ & # ! ? space * {
.PP
Therefore most people will never need more quoting than putting '\e'
in front of the special characters.
.PP
However, when you want to use a shell variable you need to quote the
$\-sign. Here is an example using \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR. This variable is set
by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR itself, so the evaluation of the $ must be done by
the sub shell started by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel \-N2 echo seq:\e$PARALLEL_SEQ arg1:{1} arg2:{2}\fR
.PP
If the variable is set before \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR starts you can do this:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains more than one space in a row:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
If the variable should not be evaluated by the shell starting \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR but be evaluated by the sub shell started by \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR, then you need to quote it:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR=this_is_set_after_starting \e; echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_after_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains space:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR='\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"' echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
$$ is the shell variable containing the process id of the shell. This
will print the process id of the shell running \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel echo $$\fR
.PP
And this will print the process ids of the sub shells started by \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel echo \e$\e$\fR
.PP
If the special characters should not be evaluated by the sub shell
then you need to protect it against evaluation from both the shell
starting \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR and the sub shell:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e\e\e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can protect against evaluation by the sub shell by
using \-q:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel \-q echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
This is particularly useful if you have lots of quoting. If you want to run a perl script like this:
.PP
\&\fBperl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"' file\fR
.PP
It needs to be quoted like this:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel  perl \-ne '/^\e\eS+\e\es+\e\eS+\e$/\e and\e print\e \e$ARGV,\e\*(L"\e\en\e\*(R"'\fR
.PP
Notice how spaces, \e's, "'s, and $'s need to be quoted. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR
can do the quoting by using option \-q:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q  perl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"'\fR
.PP
However, this means you cannot make the sub shell interpret special
characters. For example because of \fB\-q\fR this \s-1WILL\s0 \s-1NOT\s0 \s-1WORK:\s0
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} \fR>\fB{.}"\fR
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} | bzip2 \fR>\fB{.}.bz2"\fR
.PP
because > and | need to be interpreted by the sub shell.
.PP
If you get errors like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sh: \-c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token
\&  sh: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
\&  sh: \-c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \`\*(Aq\*(Aq
\&  sh: \-c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
.Ve
.PP
then you might try using \fB\-q\fR.
.PP
If you are using \fBbash\fR process substitution like \fB<(cat foo)\fR then
you may try \fB\-q\fR and prepending \fIcommand\fR with \fBbash \-c\fR:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'wc \-c <(echo {})'\fR
.PP
Or for substituting output:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'tar c {} | tee \fR>\fB(gzip \fR>\fB{}.tar.gz) | bzip2 \fR>\fB{}.tar.bz2'\fR
.PP
\&\fBConclusion\fR: To avoid dealing with the quoting problems it may be
easier just to write a small script and have \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR call that
script.
.SH "LIST RUNNING JOBS"
.IX Header "LIST RUNNING JOBS"
If you want a list of the jobs currently running you can run:
.PP
\&\fBkillall \-USR1 parallel\fR
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will then print the currently running jobs on stderr
(standard error).
.SH "COMPLETE RUNNING JOBS BUT DO NOT START NEW JOBS"
.IX Header "COMPLETE RUNNING JOBS BUT DO NOT START NEW JOBS"
If you regret starting a lot of jobs you can simply break \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR,
but if you want to make sure you do not have halfcompleted jobs you
should send the signal \fB\s-1SIGTERM\s0\fR to \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBkillall \-TERM parallel\fR
.PP
This will tell \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR to not start any new jobs, but wait until
the currently running jobs are finished before exiting.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_PID" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_PID\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_PID"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL_PID\fR is set by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR and
is visible to the jobs started from \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. This makes it
possible for the jobs to communicate directly to \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
Remember to quote the $, so it gets evaluated by the correct
shell.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR If each of the jobs tests a solution and one of jobs finds
the solution the job can tell \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR not to start more jobs
by: \fBkill \-TERM \f(CB$PARALLEL_PID\fB\fR. This only works on the local
computer.
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_SEQ" 9

.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR will be used as default options for
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. If the variable contains special shell characters
(e.g. $, *, or space) then these need to be to be escaped with \e.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR
.Sp
\&\fBcat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v ls\fR
.Sp

.Sp
\&\fBcat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v \-S\*(L"myssh user@server\*(R" ls\fR
.Sp
can be written as:
.Sp
\&\fBcat list | PARALLEL='\-kvj1 \-S myssh\e user@server' parallel echo\fR
.Sp
Notice the \e in the middle is needed because 'myssh' and 'user@server'
must be one argument.
.SH "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
.IX Header "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
The file ~/.parallel/config (formerly known as .parallelrc) will be
read if it exists.  Lines starting with '#' will be ignored. It can be
formatted like the environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR, but it is often
easier to simply put each option on its own line.
.PP
Options on the command line takes precedence over the environment
variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR which takes precedence over the file
~/.parallel/config.
.SH "PROFILE FILES"
.IX Header "PROFILE FILES"
If \fB\-\-profile\fR set, \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will read the profile from that file instead of
~/.parallel/config. You can have multiple \fB\-\-profiles\fR.
.PP
Example: Profile for running a command on every sshlogin in
~/.ssh/sshlogins and prepend the output with the sshlogin:
.PP
.Vb 2

\&\fBxargs\fR offer some of the same possibilites as \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR deals badly with special characters (such as space, ' and

.PP
.Vb 5
\&  touch important_file
\&  touch \*(Aqnot important_file\*(Aq
\&  ls not* | xargs rm
\&  mkdir \-p "My brother\*(Aqs 12\e" records"

.Ve
.PP
You can specify \fB\-0\fR or \fB\-d \*(L"\en\*(R"\fR, but many input generators are not
optimized for using \fB\s-1NUL\s0\fR as separator but are optimized for
\&\fBnewline\fR as separator. E.g \fBhead\fR, \fBtail\fR, \fBawk\fR, \fBls\fR, \fBecho\fR,
\&\fBsed\fR, \fBtar \-v\fR, \fBperl\fR (\fB\-0\fR and \e0 instead of \en), \fBlocate\fR
(requires using \fB\-0\fR), \fBfind\fR (requires using \fB\-print0\fR), \fBgrep\fR
(requires user to use \fB\-z\fR or \fB\-Z\fR), \fBsort\fR (requires using \fB\-z\fR).
.PP
So \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR's newline separation can be emulated with:
.PP
\&\fBcat | xargs \-d \*(L"\en\*(R" \-n1 \f(BIcommand\fB\fR
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR can run a given number of jobs in parallel, but has no

.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for grouping the output, therefore output may
run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process and
the last half of the line is from another process. The example
\&\fBParallel grep\fR cannot be done reliably with \fBxargs\fR because of
this. To see this in action try:

.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for keeping the order of the output, therefore
if running jobs in parallel using \fBxargs\fR the output of the second
job cannot be postponed till the first job is done.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for running jobs on remote computers.

.PP
\&\fBmake \-j\fR has no support for grouping the output, therefore output
may run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process

\&\fBParallel grep\fR cannot be done reliably with \fBmake \-j\fR because of

.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES\s0 \s-1BETWEEN\s0 ppss \s-1AND\s0 \s-1GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ppss AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBppss\fR is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.
.PP
The output of \fBppss\fR is status information and thus not useful for
using as input for another command. The output from the jobs are put
into files.
.PP
The argument replace string ($ITEM) cannot be changed. Arguments must
be quoted \- thus arguments containing special characters (space '"&!*)
may cause problems. More than one argument is not supported. File
names containing newlines are not processed correctly. When reading
input from a file null cannot be used as a terminator. \fBppss\fR needs
to read the whole input file before starting any jobs.
.PP
Output and status information is stored in ppss_dir and thus requires
cleanup when completed. If the dir is not removed before running
\&\fBppss\fR again it may cause nothing to happen as \fBppss\fR thinks the
task is already done. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will normally not need cleaning
up if running locally and will only need cleaning up if stopped
abnormally and running remote (\fB\-\-cleanup\fR may not complete if
stopped abnormally). The example \fBParallel grep\fR would require extra
postprocessing if written using \fBppss\fR.

\&\fBprll\fR encourages using \s-1BASH\s0 aliases and \s-1BASH\s0 functions instead of

.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ClusterSSH AND GNU Parallel"
ClusterSSH solves a different problem than \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
.PP
ClusterSSH runs the same command with the same arguments on a list of
computers \- one per computer. This is typically used for administrating
several computers that are almost identical.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR runs the same (or different) commands with different
arguments in parallel possibly using remote computers to help
computing. If more than one computer is listed in \fB\-S\fR \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR may
only use one of these (e.g. if there are 8 jobs to be run and one
computer has 8 cores).
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can be used as a poor-man's version of ClusterSSH:

.IX Subsection "Quoting of newline"
Because of the way newline is quoted this will not work:
.PP
echo 1,2,3 | parallel \-vkd, \*(L"echo 'a{}b'\*(R"
.PP
However, these will all work:
.PP
echo 1,2,3 | parallel \-vkd, echo a{}b
.PP

.PP

.SS "Startup speed"
.IX Subsection "Startup speed"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is slow at starting up. Half of the startup time on
the local computer is spent finding the maximal length of a command
line. Setting \fB\-s\fR will remove this part of the startup time.
.PP
When using multiple computers \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR opens \fBssh\fR connections
to them to figure out how many connections can be used reliably
simultaneously (Namely \s-1SSHD\s0's MaxStartup). This test is done for each
host in serial, so if your \-\-sshloginfile contains many hosts it may
be slow.
.SS "\-\-nice limits command length"
.IX Subsection "--nice limits command length"
The current implementation of \fB\-\-nice\fR is too pessimistic in the max
allowed command length. It only uses a little more than half of what
it could. This affects \-X and \-m. If this becomes a real problem for
you file a bug-report.
.SS "Aliases and functions do not work"
.IX Subsection "Aliases and functions do not work"

.PP
or:
.PP
\&\fBopen3: exec of by \f(BIcommand\fB failed\fR
.PP
it may be because \fIcommand\fR is not known, but it could also be
because \fIcommand\fR is an alias or a function. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will
never support running aliases and functions (see why
